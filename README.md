# Notes:
The small switch is wired inline with the positive battery lead
TP4056 handles charging via USB
Buck-boost ensures stable voltage to ESP32

# Physical Assembly
ESP32 is nserted into the bottom chassis
with Pins facing upward
Internal Layout on top of ESP32 (Front → Back)
Display
Mounted inside the front of the bottom chassis
Buck-Boost Converter
Positioned behind the display
Battery (LiPo)
Placed behind the converter
TP4056 Charger Module
Located at the rear
USB port aligned with chassis opening
Mechanical switch:
Insert through front chassis hole
Feed wires through then solder connections
before pressing into place

# After wiring:

Secure all components inside bottom chassis
Attach display to front interior
Press top chassis onto bottom to close enclosure

# Software Setup

# 1. Install Arduino IDE Libraries

Required libraries:

Adafruit GFX
Adafruit ST7735
ArduinoJson
Preferences (built-in)
WiFi (built-in)

# 2. Board Configuration
Board: ESP32S3 Dev Module
Flash Size: 8MB (or your board spec)
Partition Scheme: Default / Large App

# 3. Upload Code
Connect ESP32 via USB
Select correct COM port
Upload the provided .ino file

# 4. WiFi and Weather setup

Edit in code:

const char *WIFI_SSID = "your_wifi";
const char *WIFI_PASS = "your_password";

#define WX_LAT   "your_lat"
#define WX_LON   "your_long"

Change this to -4*3600 for EDT or -5*3600 for EST as appropriate.
#define GMT_OFFSET   (-4 * 3600)   // UTC-4  (EDT)
